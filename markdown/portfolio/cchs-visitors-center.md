Cathedral Catholic Highschool secured a donor that wanted to create a new visitor center and concession stand near their football field. It was also planned that this expansion would serve as a rental space for the personal events or game day events of alumni and students. Our design is looking to carefully match the existing California Revival architecture at the school. We didnâ€™t deviate far from the revival style except for the inclusion of decorative arch-ways and openings.
