A trend in the South and Midwest is for people to rent barns as a themed venue for music events, art shows, private parties, etc. This was the concept for our client's new property they were looking to have constructed. They wanted a barn that also incorporated nice architectural design. We wanted to create an authentic period American barn that was permanent. Our concept was to make the building seem as though it was always there by giving the exterior an aged, western type look. For the interior we designed a music venue & barcade thatâ€™s kept very playful and prop-like with a 50s theme to add some extravagance to the space. This venue would be used for rentals of all kinds and would provide plenty of privacy since it will be secluded in the middle of the woods.
