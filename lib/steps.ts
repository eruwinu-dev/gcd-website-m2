		description:
			"During this stage, we create a number of rough sketches and drawings to show the design's fundamental ideas. We hold a series of meetings with you to evaluate and debate drawings and suggested design solutions, working together to arrive at a clearly defined idea, timetable, and construction budget. Additionally, preliminary research of local compliance and regulations are finished at this time.",
